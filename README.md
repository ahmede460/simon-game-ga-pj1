## Introduction
### Game background
Simon Says is a very popular and interesting game, the game starts by making a random sequence and the user would have to memorize the sequence and demonstrate that. The sequence gets harder and harder everytime until the user can't repeat the sequence. 
### Why Simon Says?
I chose this game because I recently fell in love with it. It was part of many people's childhood but it was something new for me. Even though it felt simple to make before starting it did offer some challenge which I enjoyed and learnt a lot from.
